# Bean-and-Brew-coffee-website
This is a coffee website where you can view a menu, place a coffee or snack order at one of three locations as well as book a baking lesson for a set time/ date. This website is not complete and will be developed further alongside my studies when I have free time.

I run the website locally using XAMPP to run an Apache and MySQL server.

Main functions include:
1. Create a user account
2. View a coffee and snacks menu
3. Create an order and choose one of three locations to collect
4. Book a baking lesson

Please note that this is not a real company and that some features are still quite primitive/ need refinement to be considered a professional solution. This is just something I've worked on for a short time alongside my college studies and I will develop this further to use on my CV once completed and fully realised.
